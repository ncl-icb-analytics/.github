# North Central London Integrated Care Board
The NHS North Central London Integrated Care Board (ICB) is responsible for allocating NHS budget and commissions services. ICBs are a key change in the Health and Care Bill, and have replaced Clinical Commissioning Groups. These changes came into effect on 1 July 2022.

Integrated Care Boards are a statutory NHS organisations responsible for developing a plan for meeting the health needs of the population, managing the NHS budget and arranging for the provision of health services in the ICS area.

NCL ICB will build on existing commitments, programmes and ambitions. The principles informing the work of the ICB are:

+ __Taking a population health approach:__ We need to continue to develop the way we plan services to take into account the needs of people and communities, acknowledging the wider determinants of health. This will support tackling health inequalities across and within the communities we serve.
+ __Evolving how we work with communities:__ Embedding co-design with partners and communities in planning and designing services, and developing systematic approaches to communications and community engagement.
+ __Continued focus on boroughs:__ Partnership working within boroughs is essential to enable the integration of health and care and to ensure provision of joined up, efficient and accessible services for residents.
+ __Learning as a system:__ We have learnt a lot as a system throughout both our response to COVID-19 and our efforts to recover. Capturing this learning across primary care, social care, community, mental health and hospital services will guide our next steps for both individual services and system approaches.
+ __Acting as a system to deliver a sustainable health and care system:__ Providing high quality services enabled by workforce, finance strategy, estates, digital and data.
